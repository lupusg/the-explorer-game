## The explorer game

A python game created with pygame.  

It has two versions:
- A playable version, in which you must to collect all of the treasures. You can also kill the monsters for extra points.
- An AI version that uses the Breadth First Search (from the last discovered treasure).

## Reflection
- It was 2 weeks project (for each version) for a class I was taking called Artificial Intelligence at the Faculty of Science at the University of Craiova, but I liked the idea of making a game and it was also my first time using Python/Pygame.
- I used [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UxnelT9aCo) tutorials to understand how pygame works.
- There were a lot of obstacles, which I enjoyed because I was trying to figure out the best way to solve the problem. I remember how happy I was when I finally managed to kill a monster only when the explorer was looking at it. P.S. I'd love to leave some English comments, but my explanation was so bad that I can't understand it right now because it makes no sense ðŸ˜Ž.
- It was also supposed to have a version based on Djikstra's Algorithm, but because I didn't know much about graphs and my implementation was poor, I had to rethink a large portion of the game.
- In the end, it was the best learning experience that I had at that time. It was my second step to develop a good "Programming thinking".
